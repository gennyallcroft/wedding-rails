    <p> There are lots of accommodation options in Oxford for all different budgets. Oxford is quite small - our wedding ceremony is in the centre of town and the reception is 2 miles away. </p>
    <p> You can check out some of the options on <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/s/Oxford/homes?tab_id=home_tab&refinement_paths%5B%5D=%2Fhomes&source=structured_search_input_header&search_type=user_map_move&ne_lat=51.770804616636426&ne_lng=-1.207138009920584&sw_lat=51.72776275781044&sw_lng=-1.2958413442520964&zoom=13&search_by_map=true&query=Oxford%2C%20United%20Kingdom&adults=2&flexible_trip_lengths%5B%5D=weekend_trip&date_picker_type=calendar&checkin=2022-08-20&checkout=2022-08-21" target="_blank"> Airbnb.co.uk </a> and <a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en-gb.html?label=opensearch-plugin&lang=en-gb&sid=9ae5db0bacf22922e554025e48f23075&sb=1&src=searchresults&src_elem=sb&error_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fsearchresults.en-gb.html%3Flabel%3Dopensearch-plugin%3Bsid%3D9ae5db0bacf22922e554025e48f23075%3Btmpl%3Dsearchresults%3Bcheckin_month%3D7%3Bcheckin_monthday%3D17%3Bcheckin_year%3D2021%3Bcheckout_month%3D7%3Bcheckout_monthday%3D18%3Bcheckout_year%3D2021%3Bcity%3D-2604911%3Bclass_interval%3D1%3Bdest_id%3D-2604911%3Bdest_type%3Dcity%3Bfrom_sf%3D1%3Bgroup_adults%3D1%3Bgroup_children%3D0%3Blabel_click%3Dundef%3Bno_rooms%3D1%3Boffset%3D0%3Border%3Ddistance_from_search%3Braw_dest_type%3Dcity%3Broom1%3DA%3Bsb_price_type%3Dtotal%3Bshw_aparth%3D1%3Bslp_r_match%3D0%3Bsrc_elem%3Dsb%3Bsrpvid%3D1f7e7295759b00a3%3Bss%3DOxford%3Bssb%3Dempty%3Bssne%3DOxford%3Bssne_untouched%3DOxford%26%3B&ss=Oxford&is_ski_area=0&ssne=Oxford&ssne_untouched=Oxford&city=-2604911&checkin_year=2022&checkin_month=8&checkin_monthday=20&checkout_year=2022&checkout_month=8&checkout_monthday=21&group_adults=2&group_children=0&no_rooms=1&from_sf=1" target="_blank">Booking.com</a>. It is also possible to stay in Oxford University college accommodation, which is basic but good value and gives you a chance to stay in one of Oxford's colleges. More info can be found <a href="https://www.universityrooms.com/en-GB/search/accommodation/in/Oxford?from=20/08/2022&to=21/08/2022&rooms=1&adults=2&curr=GBP" target="_blank">here</a>. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Alternatively, it is possible to get back to London at any time of night using the 24 hour coach service (more detail on the <%= link_to 'Travel', controller: 'travel' %> page).

    <h3>Are my children invited?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
    <p>We regret that we can only accommodate a handful of close family children at our wedding. We hope you understand this decision and will still be able to join us on our special day. </p>

    <h3> What should I wear to the wedding? </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
    <p> The dress code is "summer wedding". We have organised the transport from University College to The Perch - this will involve around 15 minutes of walking on pathways so if it is a cold or wet day then bring something to keep you warm and dry. At The Perch, we will be in a marquee with hard floor. There's no need to cover your shoulders for the chapel.  </p>

    <h3> What should I get you for a gift? </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
    <p> The greatest gift we could ask for is for you to be there at our wedding so we have not set up a gift list. However, if you would like to treat us, a donation to our <a href="https://prezola.com/wishlists/10233499/" target="_blank">Honeymoon Fund</a> would be much appreciated. </p>

    <h3> What is the best way to travel to Oxford? </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
    <p> Travel info can be found in the  <%= link_to 'Travel', controller: 'travel' %> page of this website. It is very difficult to park in Oxford and there is no parking at University College or The Perch so if you are driving then we recommend using the <a href="https://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/residents/roads-and-transport/public-transport/park-and-ride" > Park and Ride</a>, or planning where you will park in advance.
