    <h3> How should I RSVP to the wedding? </h3>
    <p> Please fill in your response using the RSVP link above. Even if you have told us your RSVP using other means, we would be grateful if you could fill out the form too so we have it on record in one place. </p>
    <h3> What should I do if I need to change my RSVP? </h3>
    <p> There is the option to edit your RSVP in the RSVP section of the website. This will be disabled after 1 May 2021. If you do need to change your RSVP after this date, please get in touch with Genny or Joey as soon as possible to let them know. </p>
    <h3> What should I wear to the wedding? </h3>
    <p> The dress code is "summer wedding". We have organised the transport from University College to The Perch - there will be a little bit of walking involved so please bear that in mind. At The Perch, we will be in a marquee with hard floor, but there are some grassy areas outside too. </p>
    <h3> What should I get you for a gift? </h3>
    <p> If you would like to get us a gift, we would really appreciate a donation towards our honeymoon. You can use the Gift link above to do this. </p>
    <h3> What is the best way to travel to Oxford? </h3>
    <p> Travel info can be found in the Travel page of this website. It is very difficult to park in Oxford and there is no parking at University College or The Perch so if you are driving then we recommend using the Park and Ride. 
    <h3> What time should I get to University College? </h2>
    <p> The ceremony will start at 2pm so please arrive from 1.30pm so you can make your way to the chapel and take your seat in plenty of time.  </p>
    <h3> How long is the ceremony? </h3>
    <p> We will be having a short religious ceremony in the chapel. It should last around 30 minutes. </p>
    <h3> How are we getting from University College to The Perch? </h3>
    <p> We have organised the transport but want to keep as a bit of a surprise. We would prefer you not to make your own way between University College and The Perch. </p>
    <h3> Are we allowed to take photos? </h3>
    <p> Of course! Please do take lots of photos of the day and share any good ones with us afterwards! </p>
    <h3> What time will we be having dinner and what are we having to eat? </h3>
    <p> Dinner will be served at 5.30pm so please do eat lunch before the ceremony. We will be eating a three course feast with some different options in the middle of the table for you to help yourself. There will be pudding and wedding cake available but we won't be serving any other snacks later so please make sure you eat enough to keep you going. </p> 
    <h3> Will the drinks be free? </h3>
    <p> We will be providing some wine and beer for all of our guests during dinner and a few drinks for afterwards. The Perch has a bar which takes card and cash so you can buy extra drinks if you would like them. </p>
    <h3> Will you have a band? </h3>
    <p> Yes, we will have a soul band playing a couple of sets of party tunes for us to get dancing! </p>
    <h3> What time does the wedding end? </h3>
    <p> The wedding will end at midnight so please arrange transportation around this.
