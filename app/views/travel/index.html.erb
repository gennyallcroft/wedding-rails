    <h2>Coach</h2>
    <p>London and Oxford are connected by coach with frequent 24-hour services run by the Oxford Tube. The journey time can vary a lot depending on the traffic so please leave lots of time to get there (at least 2 hours just in case). 
    </p>
    <p>
    Oxford Tube pick-up points in London include Grosvenor Gardens (in Victoria), Marble Arch, Notting Hill Gate, Shepherdâ€™s Bush, and Hillingdon. The coach stops at a few different points in Oxford; the High Street stop is right outside University College. Details at <a href="http://www.oxfordtube.com" target="_blank">oxfordtube.com</a>.

    <h2>Car</h2>
    <p>Many Oxford streets are closed to traffic and parking is severely limited. </p>
    <p>  If you are staying in accommodation in Oxford then it is useful if it has parking for guests. Otherwise, if you would like to come by car, and you are staying overnight, we encourage you to use the <a href="https://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/residents/roads-and-transport/public-transport/park-and-ride/locations" target="_blank">Park and Ride</a> bus services. These operate between the city centre and parking areas on the outskirts. </p>   
    <p>There are five <a href="https://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/residents/roads-and-transport/public-transport/park-and-ride/locations" target="_blank">Park and Ride sites</a> which serve Oxford city centre. </p>

    <p> <a href="https://www.oxford.gov.uk/directory_record/354/thornhill_park_and_ride/category/56/park_and_ride_sites" target="_blank">Thornhill Park and Ride </a> is the site that is easiest to reach from London. The journey time for getting from the Park and Ride sites to the centre of the city is around 15 minutes. </p>
    <p>The car park is accessible 24 hours a day but buses stop running at around 19:15 from the town centre on Saturdays (timetables are available <a href="https://parkandride.oxfordbus.co.uk/timetables/" target="_blank">here</a>). Therefore, if you are not staying the night, you would need to arrange alternative travel (e.g. a taxi) to take you back to your car after the reception. </p>
    <p> <a href="https://www.oxford.gov.uk/directory/8/car_parks_in_oxford/category/53" target="_blank">Car parks</a> are also available in the city centre. Oxford City Council recommends using <a href="https://www.oxford.gov.uk/directory_record/344/oxpens_car_park/category/53/city_centre_car_parks" target="_blank"> Oxpens car park </a> if you are driving into the city centre. More details can be found <a href="https://www.oxford.gov.uk/directory/8/car_parks_in_oxford/category/53" target="_blank">here</a>.
