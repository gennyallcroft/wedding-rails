    <h2>Car</h2>
    <p>Many Oxford streets are closed to traffic and parking is severely limited. </p>
    <p>  If you are staying in a hotel then it may offer parking for guests. Otherwise, if you would like to come by car, we encourage you to use the Park and Ride bus services. </p>
    <p> These operate between the city centre and parking areas on the outskirts at Pear Tree, Woodstock Road (north); Water Eaton (north); Seacourt, Botley Road (west); Redbridge, Abingdon Road (south); and Thornhill, London Road (east). </p>
    <p> The journey time for getting from the Park and Ride to the centre of the city is between 10 and 15 minutes. The car park is accessible 24 hours a day. </p>
