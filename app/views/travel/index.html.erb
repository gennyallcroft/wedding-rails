    <h2>Coach</h2>
    <p>London and Oxford are connected by coach with frequent 24-hour services run by the Oxford Tube. The journey time can vary a lot depending on the traffic so please leave lots of time to get there (at least 2 hours just in case). 
    </p>
    <p>
    Oxford Tube pick-up points in London include Grosvenor Gardens (in Victoria), Marble Arch, Notting Hill Gate, Shepherdâ€™s Bush, and Hillingdon. The coach stops at a few different points in Oxford; the High Street stop is right outside University College. Details at <a href="http://www.oxfordtube.com" target="_blank">oxfordtube.com</a>.

    <h2>Car</h2>
    <p>Many Oxford streets are closed to traffic and parking is severely limited. </p>
    <p>  If you are staying in accommodation in Oxford then it may offer parking for guests. Otherwise, if you would like to come by car, we encourage you to use the <a href="https://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/residents/roads-and-transport/public-transport/park-and-ride/locations" target="_blank">Park and Ride</a> bus services. </p>
    <p> These operate between the city centre and parking areas on the outskirts. There are five Park and Ride sites which serve Oxford City Centre. </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Oxford Parkway (north). For satnav use OX2 8HA.  Take the 500 bus to and from the city centre. </li>
    <li>Pear Tree (north). For satnav use OX2 8JD.  Take the 300 bus to and from the city centre. </li>
    <li>Redbridge (south). For satnav use OX1 4XG.  Take the 300 bus to and from the city centre. </li>
    <li>Thornhill (east). For satnav use OX3 8DP.  Take the 400 bus to and from the city centre. </li>
    <li>Seacourt (west). For satnav use OX2 0HP.  Take the 400 bus to and from the city centre. </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p> Thornhill Park and Ride is the site that is easiest to reach from London. The journey time for getting from the Park and Ride to the centre of the city is around 15 minutes. </p>
    <p>The car park is accessible 24 hours a day but buses stop running at around 23:30 from the town centre. Timetables are available <a href="https://parkandride.oxfordbus.co.uk/timetables/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
